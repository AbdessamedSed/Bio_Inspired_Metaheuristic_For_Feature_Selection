# Bio-Inspired Metaheuristic for Feature Selection
Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for efficient feature selection in machine learning

This repository implements various bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms for feature selection, including **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**, and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. (PCA is not bio-inspired) 

## Algorithms

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Particle Swarm Optimization is a population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish. In PSO, a group of candidate solutions (particles) moves through the solution space, adjusting their positions based on their own experience and that of their neighbors. Each particle evaluates its position using a fitness function, which assesses the quality of the selected features. Over iterations, the swarm converges towards optimal feature subsets that enhance model performance by maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing overfitting.

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)

Genetic Algorithms are search heuristics that simulate the process of natural selection. They work with a population of potential solutions that evolve over generations. In the context of feature selection, each individual in the population represents a subset of features. GA uses operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to explore the search space. The fittest individuals are selected to produce the next generation, gradually evolving the population towards the optimal feature subset that improves the model's predictive capabilities.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (not bio inspired)

Principal Component Analysis is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. PCA transforms the original dataset into a new set of orthogonal features (principal components) that capture the maximum variance. This helps in identifying and selecting the most significant features while discarding noise and redundancy. By reducing the dimensionality, PCA simplifies models, speeds up training times, and can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by focusing on the most informative features.
